# Cattle price analysis in Ireland and comparing to other countries 

## Overview of agriculture



### Common Agriculture Policy (CAP)
Firstly proposed in 1962, and sixty years since its birth, the EU's CAP today supports an open single market for EU agricultural food products, ensuring affordable prices, maintaining some of the worldâ€™s highest safety and environmental standards, and keeping rural communities vibrant.

#### Brief history of CAP
1. Ensure the continuity of food production and distribution, e.g. simplifying rules for seasonal workers to cross boarders; farmers and rural development beneficiaries who were facing cash flow problems received advances, increased state aid, and loans and guarantees at favourable conditions; flexibility of using funding on rurual development, if or when extra fund is accessible under this programme.
2. Ensure a supply of safe and afforadable food, e.g, a more stable income of the famrmers based on areas and the weather impact instead of product outputs;
3. Encourage younger generations to take up farming and promote environmentally friendly farming, resulting in more development in rural areas and enabling the younger farmers' willingness to stay in countryside;
4. Pratise LEADER method to thrive remote and mountainous areas with disadvatanges;
5. Create a single common market for all products;
6. Implement EU's geographical indications to protect the rights of intellectual product;
7. Reduce power imbalance and help small farms;
8. Introduce organic farming from 2010.

#### New CAP over the peroid 2023-2027 (greener and fairer)
1. Consider the growing challenge in relation to **climate change**, **biodiversity loss** and **management of natural resources**;
2. Target better and address the specific needs of farm sector and rural areas regarding **fairness**, e.g. the distribution of income support;
3. Continue to embrace **innovation**.
